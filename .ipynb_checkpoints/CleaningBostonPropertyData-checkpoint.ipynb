    "# Cleaning Boston Property Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: 6 May 2017 \n",
    " \n",
    "Version: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Environment: Python 2.7.11 and Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries used:\n",
    "- pandas - for putting the data into the DataFrame and the suceeding DataFrame operations (pandas Developers, 2017j)\n",
    "- json - to be able to parse the '.dat' file (which is actually a semi-structured JSON file) and import it into Python (Python Software Foundation, 2017b)\n",
    "- json_normalize - normalizes semi-structed JSON data into a flat table (Pandas Developers, 2017g)\n",
    "- matplotlib.pyplot - enables us to graph a scatter plot on the data (Matplotlib Development Team, 2017)\n",
    "- re - for extracting data based on regular expressions (Python Software Foundation, 2017c)\n",
    "- numpy - for numerical calculations i.e. generation of gaussian noise and retrieval of mathematical constants (Numpy Developers, 2017)\n",
    "- datetime - for parsing dates (Python Software Foundation, 2017a)\n",
    "- sklearn.linear_model - LinearRegression - for creating a linear regression model to predict values in the data (Scikit-Learn Developers, 2017b)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "This notebook tackles about the importance of **Data Quality** and **Data Cleansing**.  This illustrates how to parse JSON files into a Python Dataframe, ensuring that all of the columns have their appropriate data types,  detection and correction of errors, outlier detection using both graphical and non-graphical methods as well as imputation of missing values using a Linear Regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleansing has always been an integral part of Data Science. The models and value that data scientists produce are only as good as the quality of the collected data, so much importance has to be given to ensure that the data used for modelling and analysis is cleaned and devoid of anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following errors were checked and corrected in this dataset:\n",
    "- Lexical errors, e.g., typos and spelling mistakes\n",
    "- Irregularities, e.g., abnormal data values and data formats\n",
    "- Violations of the Integrity constraint.\n",
    "- Outliers\n",
    "- Duplications\n",
    "- Missing values\n",
    "- Inconsistency, e.g., inhomogeneity in values and types in representing the same data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used is a semi-structed JSON file about the house sales of different cities and towns in Washington, USA from May 2014 to July 2014. Further description of the file will be discussed at the later part of the assessment.\n",

    "During parsing, error and outlier detection, in order to back up some of the corrections I have to make I will be citing some online websites which I used to cross-validate the data in the dataset. They are mainly real estate companies in the USA which are authorized to sell these properties, as such I will make an assumption here that the data in their website is of high quality and as accurate as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the websites I used to cross validate the information in this dataset are the following:\n",
    "- <a href= 'http://www.zillow.com'>Zillow</a>. **Zillow** is the leading real estate and rental web-based marketplace dedicated to empowering consumers with data, inspiration and knowledge around the place they call home, and connecting them with the best local professionals who can help. It was established in 2006 and is headquartered in Seattle.(Zillow Group Brands, 2017)\n",
    "- <a href = 'http://www.redfin.com'>Redfin</a>. According to <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redfin'>Wikipedia</a>, **Redfin** is a leading web-based real estate company  that provides a comprehensive real estate database and brokerage service, also based in Seattle.

    "### 1.2 Data Importing\n",
    "To import the data, I used Python's in-house JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) decoder called the `json.load()` function. It loads the data into a dictionary data type, where each JSON key-value corresponds to the dictionary's own key-value as well. The resulting dictionary is shown below. Note that the structure, once imported, becomes a nested dictionary i.e. a dictionary within a dictionary."

But since there are many unique cities in the dataset I've put them into a dataframe so I could view and filter them properly.(Edchum, 2016) I have primarily checked out the cities with less frequencies, as this is where most of the errors can be found. Then, I did a little bit of research to check if these tail values are valid. \n",

    "## 4. Determining Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Determining outliers.** Outliers, as defined, is an observation that is distant from other observations.(Wikimedia Foundation Inc., 2017d) It can either be an error in the dataset or an interesting trend or data that needs to be further investigated. If the outlier is considered the former, either we correct it or we delete it. If the latter, then it needs to be considered in the data, as it is vital in describing a sample or the population. (Grace-Martin, 2016)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part I will only be getting outliers from numerical variables (price, sqft_living, sqft_lot, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_above, and sqft_basement), as outliers are mainly detected by a point's distance from other points. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the outliers, I mainly used graphical methods like scatter plots, boxplots and histograms to check the extreme values. Scatterplots can be made using the **matplotlib.pyplot** library, while boxplots and histograms can be done using Pandas' `boxplot()` and `hist()` methods respectively, with the `column` parameter indicating which variable should it plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I've detected some potential outliers, it is very important to classify them whether they are a glitch or a valid data point. Same with before, I used online resources like **Zillow** and **Redfin** to continue and cross validate the values and aid me in classifying. \n"

    "#### Univariate analysis of outliers\n",
    "For the remaining numerical variables, I will also check the computed outlier bounds based from the IQR method introduced in the lecture. The IQR method is a helpful method in determining the outliers since it does not depend on the mean or the standard deviation.(Purplemath, 2017) The original formula goes like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/> upperbound = Q3 + 3 \\* IQR (upper outer fence - i.e. any value greater than this is an outlier)\n",
    "<br /> lowerbound = Q1 - 3 \\* IQR (lower outer fence - i.e. any value lower than this is an outlier)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the main problem with this is that this assumes the dataset's distribution to be normal/symmetric. As shown in the exploratory analysis above, our dataset is highly skewed to the left, so I have adjusted the threshold parameter from 3 to 4, since most of the outliers will be further than both the mean and the median of the sample. I also just get the upperbound outlier since there will be no lowerbound outliers if it's skewed this way.  "

    "Since this dataset is **positively-skewed**, I would attempt to compute the outliers using a modified version of the **IQR method.** I will use a **stronger threshold parameter 4** (instead of the normal 3) to compute for the outerfence outliers since the outliers look like more than 4 standard deviations away from the mean. I would also only consider the upper outliers to take account of its skewness--looks like there are no lower outliers as most of the observations are concentrated to the left."

For **yr_renovated**, it is understandable that not all houses have been renovated, and it cannot be imputed as it is in datetime data type. For **price**, on the other hand, the existence of a lot of 0s in the column on the tail of the dataframe indicates it may have been deliberately unfilled or accidentally deleted. This is more likely missing and should not be treated as a 'free purchase'. Since the data does not seem to depend on another variable or the missing data does not belong to a specific range in that column, it is safest to classify this as **Missing Completely at Random**."

    "This assessment illustrated different ways of cleaning a dataset through the use of different Python tools. Although data cleansing and error detection is a tedious process, it is considered the most important stage in data analysis as a poor-quality data can make or break a study/experiment. By doing this assessment, the following techniques/competencies were performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parsing a JSON file.** Through the use of Pandas' in house tools like `json` which allows json files to be imported as dictionaries into Python and `json_normalize` that flattens the files into dataframes, parsing a JSON file and turning it into a dataframe is very easy to do in Python.\n",
    "2. **Converting a column into its appropriate data type.** This is again mainly through the use of Pandas' tools like `to_datetime()` and `to_numeric()` that allows users to convert the values into another format while being robust enough to show any errors without interrupting the whole process, but also through `re`, Python's Regular Expression library, to extract and convert the data into the assessment's prescribed format through the use of different regular expressions.\n",
    "3. **Doing exploratory analysis on a dataframe** which means getting basic statistics of the dataframe through different tools like Pandas' `desc()` and `corr()` that shows the mean, median, min, max, standard deviation, quantiles, and correlation coefficient, as well as the tabulation of values via `value_counts()`, and `groupby()` to detect unique or anomalous values.\n",
    "4. **Detecting errors and duplicates** through the use of Pandas' `loc()`, `ix()`, `duplicated()` that made it easier to filter out and detect different lexical and structural anomalies as well as different graphing tools like `boxplot()`, `hist()` and scatterplots to detect outliers and missing values.\n",
    "5. **Predicting/imputing missing values** mainly by fitting a linear regression model via scikit-learn's `LinearRegression` library and using the created model for prediction and imputation.\n",
    "6. **Importance of research** since statistics is just a tool to detect anomalies, it is important to cross validate the errors or issues in the dataset with other resources in order to reconcile them. Researching skills are needed so ensure that the dataset's values is coherent with the values of other sources."
